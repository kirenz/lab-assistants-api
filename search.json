They should almost immediately move to in_progress.\n\n\nin_progress\nWhile in_progress, the Assistant uses the model and tools to perform steps. You can view progress being made by the Run by examining the Run Steps.\n\n\ncompleted\nThe Run successfully completed! You can now view all Messages the Assistant added to the Thread, and all the steps the Run took. You can also continue the conversation by adding more user Messages to the Thread and creating another Run.\n\n\nrequires_action\nWhen using the Function calling tool, the Run will move to a required_action state once the model determines the names and arguments of the functions to be called. You must then run those functions and submit the outputs before the run proceeds. If the outputs are not provided before the expires_at timestamp passes (roughly 10 mins past creation), the run will move to an expired status.\n\n\nexpired\nThis happens when the function calling outputs were not submitted before expires_at and the run expires. Additionally, if the runs take too long to execute and go beyond the time stated in expires_at, our systems will expire the run.\n\n\ncancelling\nYou can attempt to cancel an in_progress run using the Cancel Run endpoint. Once the attempt to cancel succeeds, status of the Run moves to cancelled. Cancellation is attempted but not guaranteed.\n\n\ncancelled\nRun was successfully cancelled.\n\n\nfailed\nYou can view the reason for the failure by looking at the last_error object in the Run.
