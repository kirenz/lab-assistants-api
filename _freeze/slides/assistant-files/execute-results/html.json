From the plot, we can observe the following:\\n\\n- There is a general negative correlation between Horsepower and Miles per Gallon. This means that as Horsepower increases, MPG tends to decrease.\\n- This relationship can be attributed to the fact that cars with higher horsepower values are usually more powerful and may require more fuel to sustain that power, resulting in lower fuel efficiency.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that other factors not depicted in this plot could also influence the MPG, such as the weight of the car, the type of engine, and aerodynamic design.
