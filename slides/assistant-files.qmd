# Assistants API and Files

We create an Assistant that can create data visualization based on a .csv file to demonstrate how to upload and download files using OpenAi's Assistants API.

# Setup

```{python}
import openai
from openai import OpenAI
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```


# Initialize OpenAI client

```{python}
client = OpenAI()
```


# Create Assistant

```{python}

assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    name="Data Visualizations",
    instructions="You are great at creating beautiful data visualizations. You analyze data present in .csv files, understand relationships between variables, and create data visualizations relevant to those relationships. You also share a brief text summary of the relationships observed.",
    tools=[ {"type": "code_interpreter"}],
    model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
)

```


# Create Thread


```{python}
thread = client.beta.threads.create()
```


<!--

```{python}
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Create a data visualization based on the relationship of the variables Miles_per_Gallon and Horsepower in this file. Interpret the findings",
      "file_ids": [file.id]
    }
  ]
)

```

-->

## How to Obbtain the Thread id

```{python}
thread
```

- Thread(id='thread_iB6WpSbp6r6j9ayrdHIyyafC', created_at=1699520936, metadata={}, object='thread')

. . .

```{python}
thread_id = thread.id
print(f'Thread ID: {thread_id}')

```

- Thread ID: thread_iB6WpSbp6r6j9ayrdHIyyafC


<!--

# Step 3: Add a Message to a Thread

## Create message

- A Message contains the user's text, and optionally, any files that the user uploads (no images). 

```{python}
message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="Create a data visualization based on the relationship of the variables Miles_per_Gallon and Horsepower in this file. Interpret the findings of the plot you have created",
    file_ids=[file.id]
)
```


## Obtain message id

```{python}
message_id = message.id  
print(f'Message ID: {message_id}')

```



# Annotations

- Annotations provide information around how you should annotate the text in the Message:

  - `file_citation`: File citations are created by the retrieval tool and define references to a specific quote in a specific file that was uploaded and used by the Assistant to generate the response.

  - `file_path`: File path annotations are created by the code_interpreter tool and contain references to the files generated by the tool.


## Annotations code example {.smaller}


```{python}

# Retrieve the message object
message = client.beta.threads.messages.retrieve(
  thread_id=thread_id,
  message_id=message_id
)

# Assuming the 'message' object has a 'content' attribute which is a list,
# and that the first item in the list is a MessageContentText object (as in your example)

# Extract the message content
# Make sure that the 'message.content' actually contains items before accessing
if message.content:
    message_content = message.content[0].text
    annotations = message_content.annotations
    citations = []

    # Iterate over the annotations and add footnotes
    for index, annotation in enumerate(annotations):
        # Replace the text with a footnote
        message_content.value = message_content.value.replace(annotation.text, f' [{index}]')

        # Gather citations based on annotation attributes
        # Here you must ensure that the annotation object has these attributes
        if hasattr(annotation, 'file_citation') and annotation.file_citation:
            file_citation = annotation.file_citation
            cited_file = client.files.retrieve(file_citation.file_id)
            citations.append(f'[{index}] {file_citation.quote} from {cited_file.filename}')
        elif hasattr(annotation, 'file_path') and annotation.file_path:
            file_path = annotation.file_path
            cited_file = client.files.retrieve(file_path.file_id)
            citations.append(f'[{index}] Click <here> to download {cited_file.filename}')
            # You would need to implement the file download functionality here

    # Add footnotes to the end of the message before displaying to the user
    message_content.value += '\n' + '\n'.join(citations)
    print(message_content.value)
```

- Create a data visualizations based on the relationship of the variables Miles_per_Gallon and Horsepower in this file.

-->


# Add a Message & File 

- You can attach a maximum of 20 files per Assistant 
- They can be at most 512 MB each. 
- The size of all the files uploaded by an organization should not exceed 100GB.


## Create file

- Usually, we could simply input the file in a UI
- Here, we have to upload it 

. . .


```{python}
file_response = client.files.create(
  file=open("cars.csv", "rb"),
  purpose='assistants'
)

```

. . .

```{python}
file_id = file_response.id  

print(file_id)

```

- file-4la1LvfQKJMgGxsKobJQBWkH


## Create message

- A Message contains the user's text, and optionally, any files that the user uploads (no images). 

. . .

```{python}
message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role='user',
    content="Create a data visualization based on the relationship of the variables Miles_per_Gallon and Horsepower in this file. Interpret the findings of the plot you have created",
    file_ids=[file_id]
)
```


# Create Run

- When you have all the context you need from your user in the Thread, you can run the Thread with an Assistant of your choice.

. . .

```{python}
run = client.beta.threads.runs.create(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  assistant_id=assistant.id
)
```

| STATUS            | DEFINITION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queued`          | When Runs are first created or when you complete the `required_action`, they are moved to a queued status. They should almost immediately move to `in_progress`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `in_progress`     | While in_progress, the Assistant uses the model and tools to perform steps. You can view progress being made by the Run by examining the [Run Steps](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/step-object).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `completed`       | The Run successfully completed! You can now view all Messages the Assistant added to the Thread, and all the steps the Run took. You can also continue the conversation by adding more user Messages to the Thread and creating another Run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `requires_action` | When using the [Function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling) tool, the Run will move to a `required_action` state once the model determines the names and arguments of the functions to be called. You must then run those functions and [submit the outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/submitToolOutputs) before the run proceeds. If the outputs are not provided before the `expires_at` timestamp passes (roughly 10 mins past creation), the run will move to an expired status. |
| `expired`         | This happens when the function calling outputs were not submitted before `expires_at` and the run expires. Additionally, if the runs take too long to execute and go beyond the time stated in `expires_at`, our systems will expire the run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `cancelling`      | You can attempt to cancel an `in_progress` run using the [Cancel Run](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/cancelRun) endpoint. Once the attempt to cancel succeeds, status of the Run moves to `cancelled`. Cancellation is attempted but not guaranteed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `cancelled`       | Run was successfully cancelled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `failed`          | You can view the reason for the failure by looking at the `last_error` object in the Run. The timestamp for the failure will be recorded under `failed_at`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Inspect status of the Run {.smaller}

- You need to wait until the status='completed' before you can retrieve the Messages added by the Assistant. 

- Let's check the status

```{python}
run.status
```

- 'queued'

## Retrieve current Run

- Again, check the current status with `retrieve`

```{python}
run = client.beta.threads.runs.retrieve(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  run_id=run.id
)
```


. . .

```{python}
print(run.status)

```

- 'completed'

# Retrieve Messages {.smaller}

Once the Run completes, you can retrieve the Messages added by the Assistant to the Thread.

. . .

```{python}

# Download images and files 

- The API also outputs files, such as generating image diagrams, CSVs, and PDFs. 

- There are two types of files that are generated:
  - Images
  - Data files (e.g. a csv file with data generated by the Assistant)

## Get file content

- The file content can then be downloaded by passing the file ID to the Files API


```{python}
response_file_id = assistant_response[0].image_file.file_id
```

. . .

```{python}
print(response_file_id)
```

- file-98KwkltWZr4n0kZxMUdqIzTM

```{python}
content = client.files.retrieve_content(response_file_id)

```

# Input and output logs of Code Interpreter

## Run steps {.smaller}

- By listing the steps of a Run that called Code Interpreter, you can inspect the code input and outputs logs of Code Interpreter:

```{python}
run_steps = client.beta.threads.runs.steps.list(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  run_id=run.id
)
```

```{python}

print(run_steps)

```
